"Infinite" Tic Tac Toe
====================

This is a JavaScript tic tac toe game that uses recursion to check the victory conditions so that the board
can be any size that fits in the window.

You can play it online at https://googledrive.com/host/0B9ZsDKB5V4YdS1BHUXpQUFVnYVk
If it doesn't work and you are using Chrome, check for a shield icon in your URL bar--Chrome sometimes seems to be blocking my link to jQuery. If you see the sheild, click on it and allow the script to run.
